# Armageddon

Complete an ultimate quest to stop the end of the world.

## Main Concepts
- A random quest will be given at world spawn. 
- World will be destroyed by air strikes after 21 days, unless you complete the ultimate quest.
- Somewhat UHC, except there's a death countdown.
- Disable all armor recipes.
